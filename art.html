            <p>Before 3D animation, there was 2D animation. My love for animated storytelling and digital art began when I animated my first
                bouncing ball in Pencil2D at age 6. Here are some things I've made since then.

                <h2>Quarantine Routine (2021)</h2>
                <p class="anim-text">
                    In the midst of pandemic-induced online school, I dedicated a week to creating an original short film about my experience. When one 
                    of my teachers shared it with her class over Zoom, I found it both ironic and incredible that it could create a sense of connection among my peers
                    despite the circumstances. This short won a 2021 Scholastic Art & Writing Awards Gold Key in Film & Animation.

                <h2>Finals Week: Animated (2018)</h2>
                <p class="anim-text">
                    In 2018, I created this original short film for my eighth grade capstone project. Looking back at old animations is always cringeworthy, but
                    I hold fond memories of working on it at school and having the chance to talk to a professional in the animation industry for the first time.
                    This short won a 2020 Scholastic Art & Writing Awards Silver Key in Film & Animation. Here are a few frames from the short as well as a <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/vcstudent.org/finalsweekanimated/home" target="_blank">link to the website
                    I created for the project</a></u>.
