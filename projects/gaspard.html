            <p>Modeling / Rigging / Animation / Brushstroke Tools</p>
            <p>
                Lately, I've been fascinated by the challenge of translating traditional illustration styles into 3D. 
                With the release of Blender's <a href="https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/brushstroke-tools/">Brushstroke Tools</a>, 
                I saw an opportunity to experiment and develop a look that stays true to its original artwork.
                For this project, I set out to recreate Georg Hallensleben's distinctive painterly style from Anne Gutman's 
                children's book, <i>Gaspard and Lisa, Friends Forever</i>.
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="gaspard/render.png">
                <img src="gaspard/ref.png">
            </div>
            <div class="materials-title">Building the Environment</div>
            <p>
                To begin the project, I blocked out the environment using the original painting as a reference. Since the 
                brushstrokes would later be layered on top of the geometry, my focus was on capturing the general shapes 
                rather than creating a perfectly subdivided, high-detail environment. 
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="gaspard/blocking.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                I then applied brushstrokes on top of the environment and introduced an HDRI to better match the lighting and 
                atmosphere of the reference painting. Using the Brushstroke Tools controls, I went through multiple iterations, 
                adjusting stroke appearance and refining their placement. While it took trial and error to replicate the expressive 
                texture of the original illustration, this process taught me a lot about fine-tuning stroke settings to achieve a 
                convincing hand-painted look. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges was managing the high density of brushstroke cards, which made Blender unstable. 
                Rendering frequently caused crashes, forcing me to find a balance between adding strokes, tweaking parameters, and 
                optimizing the scene for performance. This iterative workflow pushed me to think more strategically about both 
                artistic fidelity and technical efficiency.
            </p>

            <div class="materials-title">Building and Rigging the Characters</div>
            <p>I 3D modeled a base mesh for Gaspard and Lisa and then applied brushstrokes onto two versions to bring Gaspard and Lisa to life.</p>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="gaspard/mesh.png">
                <img src="gaspard/brush.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                While Brushstroke Tools works well on static meshes, rigging a character while maintaining the painterly look was a different challenge. 
                Since the brushstrokes exist as separate geometry from the base mesh, rigging the mesh alone wasn't enough. I needed a way to deform 
                both the rig and brushstrokes in sync without breaking the illusion of hand-painted strokes.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this, I made a cage-based deformation system that allowed the brushstrokes to move naturally with the character. The process involved:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Converting the brushstroke cards into a mesh
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building a low-resolution cage around the brushstroke mesh to control deformation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Weight-painting the cage for smooth movement
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parenting the cage to the rig so it would drive the brushstroke mesh
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This setup ensured that only the brushstroke mesh contributed to the final appearance while maintaining the integrity of the strokes.</p>
            <div class="images">

            </div>
            <div class="materials-title">Finalizing the Scene</div>
            <p>I constantly switched between refining the rigs and positioning Gaspard and Lisa in the scene, as posing them often revealed new rigging issues 
                that needed fixing. Once the characters were placed correctly and I animated the camera, I encountered another major challenge: the brushstrokes 
                flickered when the camera moved. To resolve this, I had to modify the environment by identifying and deleting overlapping brushstroke cards, 
                ensuring a more stable and visually consistent result.
