            <p>Python / Blender API / Whisper API / Montreal Forced Aligner / Facial Rigging</p>
            <p>
                I'm currently designing and developing a Blender add-on that generates first-pass lip sync animation
                from audio, reducing the need for manual keyframing. The tool is intended to act as an intelligent
                reference for animators, producing an initial mouth animation that can be refined rather than 
                built entirely by hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plan is to explore both traditional audio and transcript alignment and deep learning-based
                audio-to-phoneme approaches. Phoneme timing is mapped to character-specific mouth blendshapes and 
                converted into Blender animation curves, allowing the results to integrate directly into an existing
                facial rig and animation workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by procedural facial animation systems used in modern game pipelines, the add-on prioritizes 
                easy of use, customizability, and seamless pipeline integration. The goal is to streamline repetitive
                aspects of lip sync while preserving full artistic control and expressiveness for animators.
